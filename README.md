2. BACKTESTIG_PROGRAM == What is Backtesting?
> Zerodha backtesting is a trading strategy that is based on historical data, where traders use past data to see how a strategy would have performed. The definition of a backtesting application is a set of technical rules applied to a set of historical price data, and the subsequent analysis of the returns that a Zerodha strategy would have generated over a specific period of time.
> Backtesting is a type of program that allows traders to test potential trading strategies using historical data. The program recreates the behaviour of trades and their reaction to a Zerodha trading strategy, and the resulting data can then be used to measure and optimise the effectiveness of a given strategy before applying it to real market conditions. Backtesting strategies work on the assumption that trades that have performed successfully in the past will perform well in the future

5.INDICATORS (ATR,RSI,SMA,EMA,Bollinger band ) on Historical_data 'SBI'

* What Is a Technical Indicator?
> Technical indicators are heuristic or mathematical calculations based on the price, volume, or open interest of a security or contract used by traders who follow technical analysis. By analyzing historical data, technical analysts use indicators to predict future price movements. Examples of common technical indicators include the Relative Strength Index, Money Flow Index, Stochastics, MACD and Bollinger Bands®.

* How Technical Indicators Work ?
> Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysts, who attempt to evaluate a security's intrinsic value based on financial or economic data, technical analysts focus on patterns of price movements, trading signals and various other analytical charting tools to evaluate a security's strength or weakness. Technical analysis can be used on any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks, futures, commodities, fixed-income, currencies, and other securities. In this tutorial, we’ll usually analyze stocks in our examples, but keep in mind that these concepts can be applied to any type of security. In fact, technical analysis is far more prevalent in commodities and forex markets where traders focus on short-term price movements. Technical indicators, also known as "technicals", are focused on historical trading data, such as price, volume, and open interest, rather than the fundamentals of a business, like earnings, revenue, or profit margins. Technical indicators are commonly used by active traders, since they're designed to analyze short-term price movements, but long-term investors may also use technical indicators to identify entry and exit points.

6. Live_Trading_BOTS==What is a Trading BOT ?
> A Zerodha trading robot is a computer program based on a set of indian trading signals that helps determine whether to buy or sell a currency pair at a given point in time. Zerodha robots are designed to remove the psychological element of trading, which can be detrimental. While trading systems can be purchased online, traders should exercise caution when buying them this way.
> Trading bots are widely available programs that connect to a user’s indian exchange and make trades on their behalf. They work using a variety of indicators and signals, such as moving averages and indices. The idea is simple: to help users make money in the markets, while not wasting a lot of their time. The underlying assumption is that computers are much better at trading than humans could ever be, because trading is all about mathematics and complex calculations of probability.
